%description
The program will on fixed intervals check if there has been a lot of
swapping since previous run, and if there are a lot of swapping, the
program with the most page faults will be temporary suspended.  This
way the host will never become so thrashed up that it won't be
possible for a system administrator to ssh into the box and fix the
problems, and in many cases the problems will resolve by themselves.
